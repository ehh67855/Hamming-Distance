# Binary Comparison Tool

## Description

This tool is designed to compare the binary representations of two integers. It converts integers to their binary forms, adjusts their sizes to match, and then calculates the Hamming distance between them. The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

## Features

- **Binary Conversion**: Converts integers to their binary representation.
- **Size Adjustment**: Adjusts the binary representations to be of equal length by adding leading zeros.
- **Hamming Distance Calculation**: Calculates and displays the Hamming distance between two binary numbers.
